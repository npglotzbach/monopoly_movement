This is a simulation of one billion turns of a one-player game of Monopoly, tracking the spaces that the player lands on over time to arrive at a long-term probability distribution of landing on each space.

Players do not attempt to get out of jail early by playing the Get Out Of Jail Free cards if owned or by paying $50 (the concept of money is not included in this simulation anyway) but all other rules pertaining to movement should be accurately reflected.

results/jail_no_cards gives sample results from an earlier version of this program that did not implement the Chance or Community Chest decks. results/jail_and_decks is a sample output of the program as of the initial commit.
